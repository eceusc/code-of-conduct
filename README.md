The Code of Conduct that all ECE USC Open Source projects must follow. 

## The Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct is the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) with
the [UC San Diego Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html)
added as well. This is the initial version of this Code, and may change in the future.

## Installation

To add this code to your project (which is required for all ECE USC Open Source projects),
from the terminal you can simply run:

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eceusc/code-of-conduct/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

from the root project directory of your project. This will add the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` 
file to your git repo, and you'll be good to go!

## Open Source project requirements

All repos within the ECE USC Open Source Project Team will be required to use this
Code of Conduct. If theis Code changes, ECE USC will notify all project owners 
to allow for updates.
